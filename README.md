**Natural Language Analytics; Financial Data Science and Other Musings**

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael, an investment professional in private equity and structured credit with a quantitative angle and interest in the application of data science / ML directly in the investment process
- ðŸ‘€ Building on my background in Mathematics @ Oxford Uni, Iâ€™m currently interested in NLP, deep learning, transformer architecture and applications in summarisation, translation and other natural language analytical tools
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m building a natural language analytical platform with extraction tools leveraging grammatical structure as well as attention-based supervised learning in abstractive summarisation and information gathering
